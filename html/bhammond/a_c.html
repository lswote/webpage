LOU:   I  love baseball.  When we get to St. Louis, will you tell

       me the guys' name on the team so when I go to see them  in

       that  St.  Louis  ball  park  I'll be able to know those

       fellows?



BUD:   All right.  but you know, strange as it may  seems,  they

       give ball players nowadays very peculiar names, nick names,

       like "Dizzy Dean."  Now on the St. Louis team we have Who's

       on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third --



LOU:   That's what I want to find out.  I want you to tell me the

       names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.



BUD:   I'm telling you.  Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't

       Know is on third --



LOU:   You know the fellows' names?



BUD:   Yes.



LOU:   Well, then who's playin' first.



BUD:   Yes



LOU:   I mean the fellow's name on first base.



BUD:   Who.



LOU:   The fellow playin' first base for St. Louis.



BUD:   Who.



LOU:   The guy on first base.



BUD:   Who is on first.



LOU:   Well, what are you askin' me for?



BUD:   I'm not asking you -- I'm telling you.  WHO IS ON FIRST.



LOU:   I'm asking you -- who's on first?



BUD:   That's the man's name!



LOU:   That's who's name?



BUD:   Yes.



LOU:   Well, go ahead and tell me.



BUD:   Who.



LOU:   The guy on first.



BUD:   Who.



LOU:   The first baseman.



BUD:   Who is on first.



LOU:   Have you got a first baseman on first?

 

BUD:   Certainly.

 

LOU:   Then who's playing first?

 

BUD:   Absolutely.

 

LOU:   (pause) When you pay off the first baseman every month, who

       gets the money?

 

BUD:   Every dollar of it.  And why not, the man's entitled to it.

 

LOU:   Who is?

 

BUD:   Yes.

 

LOU:   So who gets it?
 


BUD:   Why shouldn't he?  Sometimes his  wife  comes  down  and

       collects it.

 

LOU:   Who's wife?

 

BUD:   Yes.  After all the man earns it.

 

LOU:   Who does?

 

BUD:   Absolutely.

 

LOU:   Well all I'm trying to find out is what's the guys name on

       first base.

 

BUD:   Oh, no, no, What is on second base.

 

LOU:   I'm not asking you who's on second.

 

BUD:   Who's on first.

 

LOU:   That's what I'm trying to find out.

 

BUD:   Well, don't change the players around.

 

LOU:   I'm not changing nobody.

 

BUD:   Now, take it easy.

 

LOU:   What's the guy's name on first base?

 

BUD:   What's the guy's name on second base.

 

LOU:   I'm not askin' ya who's on second.

 

BUD:   Who's on first.

 

LOU:   I don't know.

 

BUD:   He's on third.  We're not talking about him.

 

LOU:   How could I get on third base?

 

BUD:   You mentioned his name.

 

LOU:   If I mentioned the third baseman's name, who did I say  is

       playing third?

 

BUD:   No, Who's playing first.

 

LOU:   Stay offa first, will ya?

 

BUD:   Well what do you want me to do?

 

LOU:   Now what's the guy's name on first base?

LOU:   I'm not asking ya who's on second.

 

BUD:   Who's on first.

 

LOU:   I don't know.

 

BUD:   He's on third.

 

LOU:   There I go back on third again.

 

BUD:   Well, I can't change their names.

 

LOU:   Say, will you please stay on third base.

 

BUD:   Please.  Now what is it you want to know.

 

LOU:   What is the fellow's name on third base.

 

BUD:   What is the fellow's name on second base.


 

LOU:   I'm not askin' ya who's on second.

 

BUD:   Who's on first.

 

LOU:   I don't know.

 

BUD:   THIRD BASE!

 

LOU:   You got an outfield?

 

BUD:   Oh, sure.

 

LOU:   St. Louis has got a good outfield?

 

BUD:   Oh, absolutely.

 

LOU:   The left fielder's name?

 

BUD:   Why.

BUD:   Well, I just thought I'd tell you.

 

LOU:   Them tell me who's playing left field.

 

BUD:   Who's playing first.

 

LOU:   Stay out of the infield!

 

BUD:   Don't mention any names out here.

LOU:   Because.

 

BUD:   Oh he's Center Field.

 

LOU:   (whimpers) Center field.

 

BUD:   Yes.

 

LOU:   Wait a minute.  You got a pitcher on this team.

 

BUD:   Wouldn't this be a fine team without a pitcher.

 

LOU:   I don't know.  Tell me the pitcher's name.

 

BUD:   Tomorrow.

 

LOU:   You don't want to tell me today?

 

BUD:   I'm telling you, man.

 

LOU:   Then go ahead.

 

BUD:   Tomorrow.

BUD:   Now listen, Who is not pitching.  Who is on --

 

LOU:   I'LL BREAK YOU ARM IF YOU SAY "WHO'S ON FIRST!"

 

BUD:   Then why come up here and ask?

 

LOU:   I want to know what's the pitcher's name.

 

BUD:   What's on second.

BUD:   Now you've got it.

 

LOU:   That's all.  St. Louis had a couple of days on their team.

 

BUD:   Well I can't help that.

 

LOU:   You know I'm a good catcher too.

 

BUD:   I know that.

 

LOU:   I would like to play for the St. Louis team.

 

BUD:   Well I might arrange that.

 

LOU:   I  would  like  to  catch.  Now I'm being a good Catcher,

       tomorrow's pitching on the team, and I'm catching.

 

BUD:   Yes.

 

LOU:   Tomorrow throws the ball and the guy up bunts the ball.

 

BUD:   Yes.

 

LOU:   Now when he bunts the ball -- me being a good catcher -- I

       want  to  throw the guy out a first base, so I pick up the

       ball and throw it to who?

 

BUD:   Now that's the first thing you've said right.

 

LOU:   I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!!!!!

 

BUD:   Well, that's all you have to do.

 

LOU:   is to throw it to first base.

 

BUD:   Yes.

 

LOU:   Now who's got it?

 

BUD:   Naturally.

 

LOU:   Who has it?

 

BUD:   Naturally.

 

LOU:   Naturally.

 

BUD:   Naturally.

 

LOU:   O.K.

 

BUD:   Now you've got it.

 

LOU:   I pick up the ball and I throw it to Naturally.

LOU:   Naturally.

 

BUD:   Well, naturally.  Say it that way.

 

LOU:   That's what i said.

 

BUD:   You did not.

 

LOU:   I said I'd throw the ball to Naturally.

 

BUD:   You don't.  You throw it to Who.

 

LOU:   Naturally.

 

BUD:   Yes.

 

LOU:   So I throw the ball to first base and Naturally gets it.

 

BUD:   No.  You throw the ball to first base--

 

LOU:   Then who gets it?

 

BUD:   Naturally.

 

LOU:   That's what I'm saying.

 

BUD:   You're not saying that.

 

LOU:   I throw the ball to Naturally.

 

BUD:   You throw it to Who!

 

LOU:   Naturally.

 

BUD:   Naturally.  Well say it that way.

 

LOU:   THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING!

 

BUD:   Now don't get excited.

 

LOU:   Whose gettin excited!!  I throw the ball to first base--

 

BUD:   Then Who gets it.

 

LOU:   (annoyed) HE BETTER GET IT!

 

BUD:   That's it.  All right now Take it easy.

 

LOU:   Hrmmph.

 

BUD:   Hrmmph.

 

LOU:   Now I throw the ball to first base,  whoever it  is  grabs

       the ball, so the guy runs to second.

 

BUD:   Uh-huh.

 

LOU:   Who  picks up the ball and throws it to what.  What throws

       it to I don't know.  I don't  know  throws  it  back  to

       tomorrow -- a triple play.

 

BUD:   Yeah.  It could be.

 

LOU:   Another  guy  gets up and it's a long fly ball to center.

       Why?  I don't know, he's on third, and I don't give a darn.

 

BUD:   What did you say.

 

LOU:   I said "I don't give a darn."

 

BUD:   Oh, that's our shortstop!

 

LOU:   ABBOTT!
